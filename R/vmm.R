#Estimating the parameters of survival and migration of

#As mentioned in the above mentioned paper:
#1. Individuals were marked, released and recaptured in a patch system with >10 patches
#2. Ideally, although this is not essential, patches should be substantially different in the
  #areas and isolation
#3. The area of all patches summed up should be a small percentage of the whole landscape, thus we 
  #can ignore the patches' shapes and use centroids (as MLS does)
